            Andrew Vojak is a Software Engineer at United Launch Alliance (ULA), and is currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science
	    degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has been working professionally since
            graduating in 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science, also from the University of Illinois.
            During his time at Cerner, Andrew helped develop software to integrate physiological waveform data
            into electronic health records. He made a substantial impact on the project, and was recognized
            for his contributions around improving workflow performance and CPU utilization. At Raytheon, Andrew worked on several programs, 
            including GPS OCX where he developed a suite of tools to assist data-gathering from automated testing. With the expertise from a
            software development background, he shifted focus to implementing DevOps practices where he designed and developed standardized 
            CI/CD pipelines used program-wide.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a non-professional setting, Andrew enjoys writing (and breaking other people's) code, building new
            Raspberry Pi projects, exploring nature, and eating breakfast food at any meal. Also coffee.
